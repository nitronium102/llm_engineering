       "Here are a few:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **The first computer bug was an actual insect**: In 1947, a team of engineers was working on the Harvard Mark II computer when they found a moth stuck in one of the relays. They taped the moth to the computer log and wrote \"First actual case of bug being found\" next to it. From then on, any technical glitch or error was referred to as a \"bug.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **The first email was sent in 1971**: Ray Tomlinson, a computer programmer, sent the first email over a network ( ARPANET ) with the words \"QWERTYUIOP\" to test whether he could send and receive emails using both uppercase and lowercase letters.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **The world's first smartphone was released in 1992**: The IBM Simon Personal Communicator had a touchscreen display, email, fax, phone, and even had a calendar and address book.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Google's original name was \"Backrub\"**: When the founders created their search engine in 1996, they initially called it \"Backrub.\" However, the name was later changed to Google, which is a play on the word \"googol,\" a mathematical term for a huge number (1 followed by 100 zeros).\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **The first web browser was called \"WorldWideWeb\"**: In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee created the WorldWideWeb browser, which later became known as Nexus and then Mozilla.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **The first social media platform was Bulletin Board Systems (BBS)**: Launched in 1978, BBS allowed users to connect via dial-up modem and exchange files, messages, and information with other users on similar systems.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **The world's fastest computer is the Summit supercomputer**: Built by Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 2018, it has a peak performance of over 200 petaflops (1 petaflop = 1 million billion calculations per second).\n",
       "\n",

       "2. **The longest word in the English language**: According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the longest word in English is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, a type of lung disease caused by inhaling very fine particles of silica. It has 45 letters!\n",
       "3. **The largest living organism**: The Armillaria ostoyae fungus covers over 2,200 acres in Oregon, USA, and is estimated to be around 2,400 years old! It's considered a single living organism because it's all connected by a vast network of fungal hyphae.\n",
       "4. **The fastest land animal**: The cheetah can reach speeds of up to 70 mph (113 km/h), making it the fastest land animal on Earth. However, they can only maintain this speed for short bursts, typically around 20-30 seconds.\n",
       "5. **The deepest part of the ocean**: The Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench has a depth of approximately 36,000 feet (10,973 meters). That's deeper than Mount Everest, the highest mountain on Earth, is tall!\n",
